@1.5.0
Added Alternative Chat (overlay)
Added Clean on session change.
Added spawn commands (vehicle, object, ped).
Added spawnAI (For now it works very badly because it relies on the ai models knowing     the names of objects and peds. I might remove it in the future if I can't               improve).
Added chat spam: input text, enable/disable, send once, delay.
Added remembered messages input box for Chatbot and Insultbot (previously editable only   in the file).
Added Gemini support (choose between OpenAI and Gemini in authorization and set API key   without other changes).
  Note: Gemini Free not available in Europe and some countries (use VPN). 
  Limits: 15 requests/min, 1500 requests/day.
Changed AI Bots tab layout.
